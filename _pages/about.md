I am a electrical engineer and space scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, where I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Space Weather Laboratory working under Dr. David Sibeck. My research interest are signal and image processing, inverse problems and machine learning with applications in space physics. I am currently working on a machine learnig framework to estimate the three-dimensional (3-D) ion density distribution and energetic fluxes in the Earth's cusp. I will upload more information on the Research tap in the near future.

During my PhD, I worked on the estimation of neutral density distributions of the terrestrial exosphere. I have used static and dynamic tomographic techniques to infer the 3-D structure of the exosphere from UV data specifically Ly-alpha intensity measurements from NASA's TWINS mission. Also, I collaborated in the proposal of the upcoming NASA's Global Imager of the Dynamic Exosphere ([GLIDE](https://twitter.com/Dr_ThomasZ/status/1334611529522540544)) mission led by my PhD advisor Dr. Lara Waldrop.
