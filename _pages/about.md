I am a post-doctoral researcher at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center working under Dr. David Sibeck. My research interests are signal and image processing, inverse problems, and machine learning with applications in space physics. I am currently working on a machine learning framework to estimate the three-dimensional (3-D) ion density distribution and energetic fluxes in the Earth’s cusp. I will upload more information on the Research tap in the near future.

During my Ph.D., I worked on the estimation of neutral density distributions of the terrestrial exosphere. I have used static and dynamic tomographic techniques to infer the 3-D structure of the exosphere from UV data, specifically Ly-alpha intensity measurements from NASA’s TWINS mission. Also, I collaborated in the proposal of the upcoming NASA’s Global Imager of the Dynamic Exosphere ([GLIDE](https://twitter.com/Dr_ThomasZ/status/1334611529522540544)) mission led by my Ph.D. advisor Dr. Lara Waldrop.
