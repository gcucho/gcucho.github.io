I am a Research Scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, working under Dr. David Sibeck in the Space Weather Laboratory. My research interests are signal and image processing, inverse problems, and machine learning with applications in space physics. I am currently working on three space science topics: (1) the development of a machine learning framework to estimate the three-dimensional (3-D) ion density distributions and energetic flux in the Northern Earth Cusp, (2) the estimation of exospheric hydrogen density distributions from Lyman-alpha measurements from TWINS and a tomographic approach, and (3) the estimation of magnetosheath soft X-ray emissivities via tomographic reconstruction to support upcoming missions LEXI and SMILE.
